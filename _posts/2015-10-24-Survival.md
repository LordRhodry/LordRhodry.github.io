title: Fun with unity Tutorial - 3 - Survival
---
For those of you unfamiliar with [Unity](http://unity3d.com/), it is a free and quite powerful game engine which allows to develop games and publish them easily to different platforms.

When trying to learn to use this game engine, a logical first step is to follow tutorials.
The third of those tutorial let us create a survival horror 3rd person shooter: [Survival shooter](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/survival-shooter-project) 

I followed this tutorial and you can play the result [here](http://lordrhodry.github.io/LifeIsAGame/survival.html). (Note: You will need to install the unity web player and probably will have a better experience on Firefox)

What I would like to do now. Is to explore with those of you who wish to be a part of this experience how far we can go with this very simple concept.
Suggest ideas of new rules to apply to this game and I will try to create levels that use your ideas and make them available. 

Just use the comments section below to submit your ideas.

Let's have fun together!
