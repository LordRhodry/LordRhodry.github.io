title: Hello World, or whatever your name is!

This would be the very first post of my brand new blog.

In this blog I'll post a few post about various part of my website: [Life Is A Game](http://LordRhodry.github.io/LifeIsAGame).

I might share with you soem of my thoughts on games once in a while, but mostly I'll be talking about my passion: Card games. In all their different variations.
Traditional card games, Board games whose main mechanic uses cards, trading card games physical or digital, and their new-ish variant: "Living card game". (The mechanics of trading card games without the randomness of sealed card packs).

Soon I will add a comment system. When that is up I'll be happy to read and answer your questions.
